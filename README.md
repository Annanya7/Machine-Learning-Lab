# Implementation of Apriori Algorithm on Electronics dataset
Apriori is an algorithm, which uses an iterative approach to find frequent itemsets in a transactional database and generate association rules from these frequent itemsets. It is based on an observation that an itemset is frequent only if all its non-empty subsets are frequent. Each kthiteration of Apriori generates frequent patterns of length k.

# Prediction of Purchasing an Item based on age and salary Using KNN 
K-Nearest Neighbors is a machine learning technique and algorithm that can be used for both regression and classification tasks. K-Nearest Neighbors examines the labels of a chosen number of data points surrounding a target data point, in order to make a prediction about the class that the data point falls into. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a conceptually simple yet very powerful algorithm.

# Implementing Decision Tree on Diabtes dataset 
Decision Tree is a type of algorithm that includes conditional ‘control’ statements to classify data. A decision tree starts at a single point (or ‘node’) which then branches (or ‘splits’) in two or more directions. Each branch offers different possible outcomes, incorporating a variety of decisions and chance events until a final outcome is achieved.

# Implementing Random Forest Algorithm  on Diabetes dataset 
Random forest is a commonly-used machine learning algorithm trademarked by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler, which combines the output of multiple decision trees to reach a single result. Its ease of use and flexibility have fueled its adoption, as it handles both classification and regression problems.
